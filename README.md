Codility Question: https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/

Given 3 ints:
X, the frog's starting position
Y, the frog's desired location
D, the frog's fixed jump distance

Find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach or exceed the desired distance.

Runs in O(1) time and has O(1) space-complexity
